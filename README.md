# amiga-esp-link

This document uses the awesome esp-link firmware available here:<br />
https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link <br />

With the wifi-serial bridge we can connect a PC and an Amiga together just like with a null-modem cable (PC â‡„ Amiga) but without having to use a physical cable between the machines.

The esp-link will make it possible to do file transfers over Wi-Fi from the PC to the Amiga and vice versa using a file transfer protocol like `Zmodem` or `Kermit` on each end. A popular program for doing this on the Amiga was [Ncomm](https://aminet.net/search?query=ncomm) back in the days. On the PC side we can use for example `Tera Term` (Windows) or `Minicom` (Linux).<br />

It's also possible to get Console output of diagrom displayed from your Amiga to your PC this way. No cable needed :)<br />

No driver needs to be installed on the Amiga side as long as you don't want to replace the `serial.device` that comes with AmigaOS. A better replacement is `8n1.device` available in two versions on Aminet here: https://aminet.net/search?query=8n1  <br />
one is for AmigaDOS 2.04+ (ONLY V37+), pick the correct one for your system. I have successfully used the `8n1.device` driver at `38400` baud speed setting on a plain standard A500.


### Installing esp-link firmware

1. We start by flashing the esp-link to our esp8266 board.<br /> I'm going to do that with the `Flash Download Tools` available from Espressif.<br />
   First download the Expressif download tool for esp8266 from their site:<br /><br />
   https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools <br /><br />

2. Now hook up your ESP8266-board to your PC. I'm using a LoLin NodeMCU V3 board here, pay attention to what COM-port it gets in your system. Mine got COM3 in Windows<br /><br />

4. Ok, good now we follow the instructions on what files to download and put in to our flash download tool. I downloaded the latest stable release `esp-link v3.0.14-g963ffbb` but I could probably have chosen the latest alpha-release instead<br />

   <br />
   
5. Now flash the device usign the Flash Tool, it's important to untick the `DoNotChgBin`-checkbox and put in the correct hex-addresses and COM-port to match your board.<br /><br />
